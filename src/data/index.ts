  section_1: {
    body: `<p>
        A top tier agency typically charges $100-150K for a modest brand design project.
        These costs subsidize the fancy “studio” space, the modern art that adorns the
        walls, and the supposed senior team “dedicated” to your business. However, if you
        look beneath the veneer of the wine-dine-and-design approach, the reality becomes
        clear. Clients are constantly juggled, projects are divyed up, and deliverables
        are passed off to freelancers. Ultimately the quality of work is contingent on
        individual talent, not the name on front door.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        That’s why we believe the best brand design doesn’t need to cost an arm and a leg.
        Because it doesn’t take an agency, an army, or a committee. Just one great
        designer.
